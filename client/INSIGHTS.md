# INSIGHTS — client (`@devdigest/web`)

Append-only engineering insights for this module. Read before you write; add only
significant, non-obvious learnings. See `../.claude/skills/engineering-insights/SKILL.md`
for the rubric.

## What Works
<!-- Approaches, patterns, and solutions that proved effective. problem → what to do. -->

- **Hover popover in a table MUST portal to `document.body` with `position:fixed`.**
  `vendor/ui/primitives/FindingsPopover.tsx` is the module's first real popover
  (everything else used native `title`). An absolutely-positioned popup gets clipped
  by any `overflow:hidden` ancestor — the PR-list `tableCard` (`pulls/styles.ts`) has
  it, so a downward popup was cut off. Fix: `createPortal` to `document.body`, compute
  `fixed` coords from the anchor's `getBoundingClientRect()` in a `useLayoutEffect`,
  flip above when `spaceBelow` is tight, and cap `maxHeight` to the viewport.
  2026-07-09: supersedes the earlier "keep popup a DOM descendant" note below — the
  portal breaks the parent/child link, so `mouseleave` DOES fire when moving onto the
  popup; attach the show/hide handlers to BOTH the anchor wrapper and the portaled
  popup, with a ~120ms close delay, to keep it open across the gap. (2026-07-09)

- **Route error boundaries split by whether the next-intl provider survives.**
  `app/error.tsx` and `app/not-found.tsx` render INSIDE the root layout, so the
  design-system CSS + locale are present — use `useTranslations`/`getTranslations`
  and design tokens there. `app/global-error.tsx` REPLACES the root layout when the
  layout itself throws, so it has NO provider and NO CSS: it must render its own
  `<html>/<body>`, use literal copy, and inline all styles. Don't reach for `t()` or
  `var(--…)` in global-error — they won't resolve. (2026-07-10)

- **A modal's focus-trap/Escape effect must run ONCE on mount (`deps: []`), reading
  `onClose` via a ref.** `vendor/ui/kit/Modal.tsx` keeps `onCloseRef.current = onClose`
  each render and the effect depends on `[]`. Keying the effect on `[onClose]` re-runs
  it on every parent render (onClose is usually an inline arrow), which re-focuses the
  dialog and steals focus mid-typing. Store previously-focused element on mount, restore
  it on unmount. (2026-07-10)

- **A line-numbered / syntax-highlighted code editor = transparent-caret `<textarea>`
  layered over a highlighted `<pre>` + a gutter, no editor lib.** `vendor/ui/kit/CodeEditor.tsx`
  is the pattern: three stacked layers must share IDENTICAL font, `padding`, and a fixed
  numeric `line-height` (px, not unitless) or the caret drifts from the rendered text.
  Set the textarea `color:transparent` + `caretColor:var(--text-primary)`, `wrap="off"`,
  and on its `onScroll` mirror `scrollTop/Left` onto the `<pre>` and gutter. Highlight
  by rendering React nodes per line (a regex pass — headings/list-markers/fences), NOT
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, so there's no escaping/injection concern. Native `placeholder`
  is invisible under `color:transparent` — render the placeholder in the `<pre>` layer
  when `value===""` instead. Drop-in for `<Textarea>` (same value/onChange/rows). (2026-07-11)

## What Doesn't Work
<!-- Dead ends and antipatterns. The most valuable section — don't skip it. -->

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Project conventions, architecture and naming decisions specific to this module. -->

- **Native HTML5 drag-reorder should reorder by ID, not by list index.** The agent
  editor's Skills tab (`AgentEditor/_components/SkillsTab`) lets you filter the list
  AND drag to reorder. If `onDrop` reordered by the rendered index, a filtered view
  would move the wrong row. Track `dragId`, and on drop splice within the full
  `order: string[]` at `indexOf(targetId)` — correct under any filter. The checkbox
  = link membership (attach/detach via `POST /agents/:id/skills { skill_ids }`);
  there is no per-agent "enabled" flag, so "attached" IS "enabled for this agent".
  Keep a local `order` state and resync from the server set via an effect keyed on
  `linkedIds.join(",")` so post-mutation cache writes don't fight optimistic order.
- **The icon registry (`vendor/ui/icons.tsx`) is a fixed lucide subset — check
  before using.** `Sparkles`, `Upload`, `Link`, `Globe`, `Menu`, `Star`, `Trash`,
  `Eye`, `History`, `BarChart`, `FlaskConical`, `Play` exist; `GripVertical` and
  `Download` do NOT. Use `Menu` for a drag handle and `Plus` for an import action, or
  add the lucide import to the registry first. `Edit` is an alias for `Pencil`.
  (2026-07-11)

- **A master–detail screen with a shared list should render ONE component from both
  routes, not duplicate the list.** The Skills page (`_components/SkillsWorkbench`) is
  rendered by BOTH `/skills/page.tsx` and `/skills/[id]/page.tsx`; the `id` prop drives
  the right pane (editor vs "select a skill"). Selecting a card is `router.push`, tab
  state lives in `?tab=` via `router.replace`. This is cleaner than AgentDetailView,
  which re-declares the left list. **Inline create-draft pattern:** an editor's Config
  tab takes `skill?` — with a skill it edits; without one it's a draft whose first Save
  `POST`s and calls `onCreated(created)` so the parent routes to `/skills/[id]`. No
  empty rows are created until save. `@devdigest/ui` already exports a `Markdown`
  primitive (react-markdown + gfm) — use it for "rendered" previews instead of a new
  dep, and a ~25-line LCS `lineDiff` covers a version-diff modal without a diff lib.
  (2026-07-11)

- **"Reveal a child by nonce" — to expand/scroll to a component that owns its own
  state.** A bare id or URL param can't re-trigger for the *same* value (re-clicking
  the same finding). Pattern: parent holds `{ id, n }` state, bumps `n` on every
  request; the child effect keys on `[revealNonce, id]` and acts. Used by the
  Agent-runs tab twice: run-scroll (`ReviewRunAccordion` `targetRunId/targetNonce`)
  and finding-reveal (`FindingsTab` → accordion → `FindingsPanel` → `FindingCard.reveal`
  → `setExpanded(true)` + `scrollIntoView`). When the target may be hidden by a filter,
  force-include it (`FindingsPanel` re-adds the revealed finding even under a severity
  filter / hide-low). In tests, stub `Element.prototype.scrollIntoView = vi.fn()` —
  jsdom doesn't implement it and the reveal effect will throw otherwise. (2026-07-10)

- **A PR-list column spans four coordinated edits.** The table is CSS-grid driven:
  add the track to `GRID` and the key to `COLUMN_KEYS` (`pulls/constants.ts`), render
  the cell in `PRRow.tsx`, and add the `list.columns.<key>` string in
  `messages/en/prReview.json`. Miss one and the header/rows misalign silently.
- **Reusable inline badges should inherit colour, not set it.** `RunCostBadge` renders
  normal in the PR list but muted in the timeline by leaving `color` unset for a
  present value (inherits the cell) and forcing `--text-muted` only on the empty dash.
  Hard-coding `--text` made it clash with the muted timeline row. (2026-07-09)

- **Destructive confirms go through the promise-based `useConfirm()` (`lib/confirm.tsx`),
  never `window.confirm`.** `<ConfirmProvider>` (mounted in `lib/providers.tsx` under
  RepoProvider) renders a single `<ConfirmDialog>` and `useConfirm()` returns
  `(opts) => Promise<boolean>`, so call sites read `if (await confirm({ title, message,
  danger: true })) mutate()`. It works from hooks too — `useShellContext.onRemoveRepo`
  became `async` and awaits it. Accessible (focus-trapped Modal + Escape) and testable,
  unlike the native blocking dialog. (2026-07-10)

- **Reset a colocated form on identity change with `key={agent.id}`, not a prop→state
  sync effect.** `AgentEditor` renders `<ConfigTab key={agent.id} agent={agent} />`; the
  remount re-runs ConfigTab's `useState` initializers. This replaced a 9-`setState`
  `useEffect([agent.id])` (a "you-might-not-need-an-effect" case) and its
  `eslint-disable`. Regression test asserts a local edit doesn't leak across an agent
  switch. (2026-07-10)

- **All query hooks forward React Query's `AbortSignal` to fetch.** `api.get(path, signal?)`
  passes it into `apiFetch`; queryFns are `({ signal }) => api.get(path, signal)` so
  navigating away / refetching cancels the in-flight request. Mutations don't take a
  signal. (2026-07-10)

- **Per-route tab titles need a SERVER page — a `"use client"` page can't export
  `metadata`/`generateMetadata`.** Root `layout.tsx` sets
  `title: { default: "DevDigest", template: "%s · DevDigest" }`, so a route only sets a
  short `title` ("Agents") and it renders "Agents · DevDigest". Pattern for the pilot:
  keep `page.tsx` a thin Server Component that renders a colocated client `*View`; add
  static `metadata` (e.g. `/agents`) or async `generateMetadata({ params })` (Next 15:
  `params` is a Promise — `await` it; see `/settings/[section]`). Pages that hold client
  hooks in the page BODY (`/agents/[id]`, `/repos/**/pulls`, `pulls/[number]`, `/`) must
  first have that body extracted into a client `*View` before they can earn a title —
  larger follow-up. Dropping a redundant page-level `"use client"` (as on `/onboarding`,
  a pure wrapper) also makes it statically prerenderable → smaller first-load JS. (2026-07-10)

- **The sidebar is fully data-driven — adding a nav section/item is a `vendor/ui/nav.ts`
  edit only.** `shell/Sidebar.tsx` `.map`s over `NAV` groups (renders each `section`
  header) and appends `SETTINGS_ITEM`; `activeKeyFor()` (`components/app-shell/helpers.ts`)
  already reserves keys for not-yet-built routes (conventions/eval/memory/…), so no
  renderer change is needed. The Pull Requests count badge is ALSO already wired —
  Sidebar injects `badge: String(ctx.prCount)` onto the `pulls` item when `ctx.prCount`
  is set; don't add a static badge in `nav.ts`. Only list items whose pages exist —
  a nav item pointing at a missing route just 404s. (2026-07-11)

- **A new `@devdigest/ui` primitive that uses hooks/refs does NOT need a `"use client"`
  directive.** No file in `vendor/ui/kit/` declares it — not even `Modal.tsx` (3 hooks).
  They inherit the client boundary from the `"use client"` app pages that render them.
  Match that: don't sprinkle `"use client"` on design-system components. (2026-07-11)

## Tool & Library Notes
<!-- Quirks and gotchas of dependencies/tooling. -->

- **The UI `Severity` type (`vendor/ui/tokens.ts`) is wider than the contract one.**
  It adds `INFO`, so indexing a 3-key `{CRITICAL,WARNING,SUGGESTION}` counts object
  by a `Severity` from `@devdigest/ui` fails typecheck (`Property 'INFO' does not
  exist`). Narrow the iteration keys with `as const` (e.g.
  `["CRITICAL","WARNING","SUGGESTION"] as const`) rather than typing them `Severity[]`.
  Contract-side `Severity` (`vendor/shared/contracts/findings.ts`) is the 3-value enum. (2026-07-09)

## Recurring Errors & Fixes
<!-- An error seen more than once + its fix. -->

- **Threading React Query's `AbortSignal` into `fetch` requires letting `AbortError`
  propagate — don't wrap it as a network error.** `apiFetch`'s `catch` originally turned
  EVERY fetch rejection into `ApiError(status 0, "network_error")`. Once the query signal
  is passed to `fetch`, a cancelled request (refetch / `refetchOnWindowFocus` / navigation
  — `usePulls` does all three) rejects with a `DOMException` `AbortError`, which then got
  mislabeled as "Cannot reach the DevDigest engine" and fired the global `status === 0`
  error toast on ordinary navigation. Fix: `if (e instanceof DOMException && e.name ===
  "AbortError") throw e;` before the network-error wrap, so the query layer sees a
  cancellation, not a failure. (2026-07-10)

- **`useConfirm must be used within <ConfirmProvider>` in component tests.** Any
  component that (even indirectly) calls `useConfirm` — e.g. `AgentCard`'s delete button —
  throws when rendered bare. Wrap the test tree in `<ConfirmProvider>` alongside the
  existing intl/query/toast providers (see `AgentCard.test.tsx`'s `renderWithIntl`). Same
  class of failure as a missing `ToastProvider`. (2026-07-10)

## Session Notes
<!-- Datestamped one-liners, newest first: ### YYYY-MM-DD -->

### 2026-07-12 (Conventions: inline rule edit + evidence deep-link)
Closed two gaps on `ConventionCandidateCard` that were **pure UI wiring over a backend that
already worked**: `PATCH /conventions/:id` accepted `{rule}` and `useAcceptConvention` already
sent it — no UI ever called it with a rule, so inline edit needed ZERO hook/server change.
Worth internalising: before building a "missing" feature here, check whether the hook and
route already support it. Details. (1) The rule editor copies `InlineComposer`'s shape
(Textarea + Save/Cancel, Esc cancels, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter saves) — the house precedent for
edit-in-place; there is still no generic `EditableText` primitive. (2) `evidence_path` is a
PACKED string (`"file:23-25"`), not structured fields, so linking it needs a parser — added
`parseEvidencePath` next to the existing `githubBlobUrl` in `lib/github-urls.ts` (splits on
the LAST colon; a non-numeric suffix falls back to a bare path). Reuse `githubBlobUrl`; don't
write a second URL builder. (3) `MonoLink` already emits `<a target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">` when given `href` — it IS the GitHub-link primitive; render plain
text (not an href-less MonoLink, which becomes a pointless `<button>`) when there's nothing
to link to. Link only when repo full_name AND `evidence_sha` are both present. (4) Re-scan is
a destructive full replace server-side, so it silently ate hand-edited rules — gated it behind
the existing `useConfirm()`. Typecheck + 83 tests green (+19).

### 2026-07-11 (Conventions tab + Skill Dynamics)
Built the Conventions tab (Skills Lab). Mostly wiring — `messages/en/conventions.json`,
the `ConventionCandidate` contract, the `/conventions` key in `activeKeyFor`, and the
`ListChecks` icon all pre-existed. Net-new: `app/conventions/` (thin page → single-column
`ConventionsWorkbench`, NOT master–detail like Skills), `ConventionCandidateCard`
(confidence bar + Accept/Reject mirroring `FindingCard`'s `active`/`disabled` pattern),
and `CreateSkillModal`. The create-from-conventions flow reuses the import→confirm shape:
a server endpoint (`GET /repos/:id/conventions/skill-draft`) returns an UNSAVED merged
draft, the modal edits it, then the EXISTING `useCreateSkill` (`POST /skills`) persists —
on success `router.push('/skills/{id}?tab=config')` to land on the new skill's Config tab.
Gotcha: `TraceSection`'s `icon` prop is a restricted union
(`Settings|Gauge|FileText|Wrench|Code|AlertOctagon`) — "Sparkles" fails typecheck; used
`FileText` for the new **Skill Dynamics** trace section, which renders `trace.config.skills`
(per-skill exact body via `PromptBlock`), guarded `!= null` so old traces still render.
Typecheck + 64 client tests green (+4 ConventionCandidateCard).

### 2026-07-11 (Skills Lab design pass)
Aligned the Skills screen to new designs (delta pass — feature already existed). (1)
Split the single-group sidebar into WORKSPACE (Pull Requests) + SKILLS LAB (Skills,
Agents) — pure `nav.ts` edit; omitted the unbuilt GLOBAL/Conventions/Eval/… items. (2)
New `vendor/ui/kit/CodeEditor.tsx` (textarea-overlay, line numbers + md highlight) swapped
into ConfigTab's body field. (3) StatsTab given its final layout — real used_by/agents
list + SAMPLE pull%/accept%(ring)/findings/by-category `Donut`, with an honest "sample
data until reviews attribute findings" caption; no backend/schema change. Typecheck +
60 tests green (+4 CodeEditor).

### 2026-07-11 (self-review fixes)
Post-refactor review caught 3 latent bugs, now fixed: (1) `Modal`'s a11y key handler
was a `document` listener that fired for every open modal — added a module-level
`modalStack` so only the topmost modal reacts to Escape/Tab (stacked
ConfirmDialog-over-modal no longer closes both / fights the focus trap); (2)
`ConfirmProvider` orphaned the prior promise when `confirm()` was called while one was
open — it now settles the previous pending as `false` before replacing it; (3) reverted
`TraceBody` specs key to a composite `${sp}-${i}` (static list; the bare `key={sp}` added
a needless uniqueness assumption). Typecheck + build + 44 tests green.

### 2026-07-11 (audit items #9–#11)
Reconciled the query hooks back to `() => api.get(path)` after `api.ts` dropped the
AbortSignal param (kept the codebase self-consistent; green baseline restored). #9 tests:
+7 (44 total) — `parseSeverity` (PrDetailView helper), `ReviewNotices`, `LiveReviewBanner`
(RunStatus stubbed); `RunRow`'s outcome logic is already covered indirectly by
`RunHistory.test`. #10: wrote `docs/styling.md` — the decision record for `styles.ts`
inline-object + CSS-var-token styling and why Tailwind stays inside `vendor/ui` only.
#11: `docs/react-compiler.md` — React Compiler pilot is *prepared not activated* (needs
`pnpm add -D babel-plugin-react-compiler`; can't install here — pnpm absent, npm would
corrupt the pnpm node_modules; flipping the flag without the plugin breaks the build).

### 2026-07-10 (frontend hardening)
Acted on a React/Next best-practices audit of `client/`. Added route boundaries
(`error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`); replaced all 4 `window.confirm`
calls with an accessible promise-based `useConfirm()` + `ConfirmDialog`; gave `Modal`
focus-trap/Escape/`aria-labelledby`; swapped ConfigTab's reset-effect for
`key={agent.id}`; threaded `AbortSignal` through every query hook (+ fixed the
abort-masquerade bug); fixed filterable-list keys (`DiffViewer`→`path`, specs→string).
Next.js audit verdict: mostly covered (client-hook params, layout `<Suspense>`
legitimizes `useSearchParams`, no img/font concerns); the real gap is per-route metadata
(blocked by client-component pages). RSC/metadata pilot: title template in root layout +
static/`generateMetadata` on `/agents`, `/settings/[section]`, `/onboarding`, and
extracted `/agents/[id]` and `/repos/**/pulls/[number]` bodies into
`_components/AgentDetailView` / `_components/PrDetailView` so both pages are thin Server
Components with metadata — the PR page derives a dynamic title ("PR #123") straight from
the route param, no fetch. #8 splits: `FindingsTab` 255→191 (LiveReviewBanner /
ReviewNotices / ReviewRunsHeader), `RunHistory` 255→82 (RunRow / CommitRow), `PrDetailView`
203→195 (parseSeverity → helpers.ts, PrDetailSkeleton). Every feature component is now
≤200 lines; only the dev-only `Showcase` gallery remains larger. Typecheck + build + 37
tests green throughout.

### 2026-07-10
Made popover finding-rows clickable → open that finding on the Agent-runs tab
(expand + scroll). PR-list path deep-links via `?finding=<id>`; timeline path reveals
in-place and clears the severity filter. Reused the run-scroll nonce pattern at card
granularity; `FindingCard` gained a `reveal` nonce prop.

### 2026-07-09
Added findings-severity counters + hover popover + `?severity=` filter to the PR list
and agent-runs timeline. New `FindingsPopover` primitive and shared
`components/FindingsSeverityCounts`; timeline counts derived client-side via
`RunHistory/helpers.ts` (`findingsByRun`), list counts from the server rollup.
