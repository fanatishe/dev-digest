/**
 * PORTS ring — the ONLY module in this package allowed to name `@devdigest/shared`,
 * and only ever on an `import type` line.
 *
 * Why: `mcp` pins zod ^3.25 (the SDK v1 peer dep) while `server` stays on ^3.24.
 * A VALUE import from the shared barrel would load a second zod instance into the
 * process and break `instanceof` in ways that surface far from the cause. Types are
 * erased at compile time, so `import type` costs nothing at runtime.
 *
 * Corollary: we do NOT re-`.parse()` API responses. The API already validated them
 * through `fastify-type-provider-zod` on the way out. Type them; don't re-parse them.
